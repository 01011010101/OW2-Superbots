### March 8, 2024

### March 7, 2024
* Team 1
  - LIFEWEAVER: Added new abilites: Choice of damage when using Ult, replaced Life Grip with teleport. Reason: Lowering Life Grip's CD resulted in trolling, and increasing the CD made it useless, so I replaced it entirely.

### 04/24/2020 - 05/21/2020 (1.00 PTR)<br>
  CORE:  
    Updated all HUDs, all icons and all descriptions.  
    Halved everyone’s damage and halved the bot’s max HP on level up.  
    Changed Armor tiers to be a flat +25.  
      Tier 1: 0 Ranged  
      Tier 2: 25 Support  
      Tier 3: 50 Bruisers  
      Tier 4: 75 Tanks  
  RELICS:  
    Relic descriptions have been shortened now so they take up less room on screen, however I have added new instructions on screen.  Holding [Crouch] will allow you to display more information per relic you have equipped.  Hopefully this should clear up any confusion on what your relic does.  

  All Relics have been reworked or improved.  
  Fixed an issue when selecting a relic then switching heroes would automatically equip you with that relic while inside of the spawn room, which is unintended.  
  Purified:  
    +100% Healing dealt and received.  
    +50% Damage when full health.  
    +10% HP per second.  
  Vortex:

    +Damage based on current Movement speed.

    -25 Armor  
    +5% Ultimate Generation per kill

    +10 ~ 25 Armor based on role. (10 if you are a tank, 25 everyone else)  
    +25% Damage per nearby bot, for a total of +150% Damage.  
    +Shield invulnerability when you’re low on HP, 40 second cooldown.  
  Hero:  
    +25% Damage.  
    +25% Movement speed.  
    +25% HP per elimination.  
    -1 Second cooldown on damage dealt.  
  
  HEROES:  
    Removed Third Person camera for a few character’s ultimates that didn’t work out after all, like Pharah and Roadhog.  But added third person to other abilities to improve the gameplay feel for unique abilities.  
    Changed Armor tiers for some characters:  
      TORBJORN 75 -> 50  
      MERCY 50 -> 25  
      ECHO 50 -> 25  
      LUCIO 50 -> 25  
      BRIG 50 -> 25  
      REAPER 25 -> 50  
      SOMBRA 25 -> 50  
      SIGMA 25 -> 0  
    Ana   
      Reduced size of primary AoE heal by 2m down to 5m, corrected the effect.  
      Primary attacks now apply a 10 second weak poison that deals 1% of a bot’s max HP every second, but this poison keeps stacking if you continue to deal damage.  
    Baptiste  
      Jumping height slightly increased so that you get better air with hover boots.  
      Unlimited ammo turned on again.  
      Full-Auto removed.  
      Ultimate Full-Auto: Grants Full-Auto and double damage after placing Amplification Matrix.  
    Hanzo  
      Removed automatic storm arrows.  
      Burning from fire arrows now stacks on targets.  
      Sonic Arrow now applies Burning or Frozen to all enemies in a 10 meter radius if you land the shot on an enemy, the burn and freeze from this arrow are much stronger.  
    Lucio  
      Removed damage bonus from movement speed on boop, moved it to Vortex.  
      Removed Primary attack.  
      Reduced Soundwave knockback.  
      Soundwave (Tinnitus) deals knockback based on movement speed.  
      Soundwave (Tinnitus) heals based on movement speed.  
      Lucio’s base damage increased to 400% (makes Soundwave deal 100 damage).  
      Amp It Up doubles Lucio’s damage for the duration.  
      Lucio takes reduced damage based on his current movement speed.  
      Removed the ring effects from his ultimate, it was causing too much visual chaos.  
    Moira - Changed her HUD text to display as In-World Text so that everyone can see what her ultimate’s current charge is at.  
    Pharah - Reworked:  
      Rebalanced damage gained from Fusion Reactor.  
      Removed Emergency Repairs.  
      Fusion Reactor: Now starts at 0% and builds to 999%, can no longer go past the limit by earning eliminations, but eliminations still give 25%.  
      Bunker Buster: Reduced cost from 150% to 100%.  BB can now be used even if you don’t have any fusion reactor power, it’ll just be much weaker.  
      Booster Dash: Fly forward without gaining or losing altitude while holding [secondary fire].  You take less damage while Booster Dashing.  
    Reaper  
      Renamed Rampage to Creeping Death, improved visuals, polished scripts.  
      Moved shadow teleport to melee, apparently it’s easier to use for some people.  
    Reinhardt  
      Sonic Charge now phases out Reinhardt for 1.5 seconds.  
      Scorching Wave can now stack and re-apply burning.  
      Symmetra - Fixed a glitch that made other characters spawn while holding secondary fire after having played with Symmetra, thanks @Scourge for the fix.  
      Nerfed impulse mine’s activation from 4 seconds to 5 seconds.  
    Torbjorn - Reworked:  
      Can use Rivet Gun again.  
      Dwarven Rage: [Ability 2] Overload enhances your abilities and heals for 25% HP and doubles your damage for the duration.  
      Dwarven Leap: Hold [Crouch]+[Jump] to leap forward in the air.  
      Dwarven Rage: Knockdown bots and set them on fire when you land.  Also phases you out for the duration of the leap.  
      Molten Punch: [Melee] sets bots on fire.  
      Can stack the burn effect.  
      Dwarven Rage: Knockdown bots when punched as well.  
    Winston - Removed Harambe’s Rage, moved it to Aegis.  Renamed ultimate to “Harambe’s Revenge”.  
    Zenyatta - Reduced healing area of primary fire from 10 to 5 to match Ana’s healing area, also fixed the ring effect to match the healing area.  
  
  SUPERBOTS:  
    Bots Level up faster now.  Every 10 deaths = 1 level.  
    Removed Overtime speed bonus.  
    Added Overtime Challenges during overtime.  
      Separation Anxiety  
      Social Distancing  
      Relentless  
      Sudden Death  
      Juggernaut  
      Swarm  
      Apotheosis  
    Removed all permanent icons.  
    Removed Lucio’s “Danger” sound, since it wouldn’t work consistently.  
    Changed Lucio’s “Danger” text to now be a Warning icon -> ⚠.  
    Increased Lucio’s knockback cooldown.  
    Lowered Damage on Bastion and Torbjorn.  
    Lowered Reaper’s stun from 0.8 to 0.5, now it should be easier to avoid death if you react fast enough on certain characters.  
    Zarya’s Death Sphere now instantly kills any players inside upon expiration.  
  
### 04/14/2020 (0.99.9f)  
  HEROES:  
    Echo - Added Echo base functionality so she doesn’t break the game.  Will add custom changes to her in the next version.  
  
### 04/13/2020 (0.99.9e1)  
  HEROES:  
    Junkrat - Fixed a script where his money would be infinitely adding to a total earned.  Fixed his money earned message so that now it consolidates multiple earnings from eliminations into one message.  Made Killpile roulette teleport slightly above payload, needs testing.  
    Symmetra - Did a first pass on her rework, reverted her invincible change.  Now she takes damage again but her impulse mine constantly deals damage as soon as it’s ready again.  4 Second cooldown between pulses.  Still a work in progress, will keep an eye on her.  
  
### 04/06/2020 - 04/10/2020 (0.99.9e)  
  CORE:  
    Some characters such as Doomfist and Junkrat that instantly killed enemies now cause damage over time, which simulates instantly killing them, but it should give more credit towards POTG.  
    Some characters now use Third-Person while using their ultimates.  
    Fixed and updated a couple of HUDs, work in progress.  
  
  RELICS:  
      Aegis - Now increases the player's armor by 10% as well.  
      Hero - 25% Damage, 25% Speed and 25% Max HP recovered per elimination.  Rebalanced the relic so that it’s equally as good as the others, just in a different way.  Also removed lifesteal since it was heavy on server resources and some characters benefited from it while others didn’t at all.  I reduced the speed because 50% felt like too much at higher levels, especially for people that particularly avoid Vortex for that very same reason.  
      Hero - Fixed an oversight where equipping Hero over and over would result in infinitely increased damage.  
      Vortex - Fixed slide animation not showing up or working as intended.  Reduced the stun of the slide slightly.  
  
  HEROES:  
    Ana - Increased primary healing from 100 to 150.  
    Baptiste - Buffed Damage.  Now has full auto, but infinite ammo turned off.  
    Bastion - Proton Cannon now deals damage based on how strong the bots are, so his scaling adapts instead of dropping off in the later game.  Gonna start doing this to all DPS characters that need it, nobody else.  
    D.va - Fixed Bunny Hop not working, added third person camera to it.  
    Doomfist - Some of his super attacks knockdown now, so he gets credit on some environmental kills.  Landing a super will heal him for 25% of his max health over 3 seconds.  
    Junkrat - Buffed his damage.  Updated and polished Kill Pile and Point explosion roulette, they’re more reliable now and less subject to “nothing” happening.  Hopefully fixed his money message, needs testing.  
    Lucio - Resurrecting players now grants 10% bonus damage.  
    McCree - Increased his base damage and now his ultimate sends enemies flying after a random interval, pay attention and shoot them when they go into the air.  You have to be far away from the bots when you activate ult, because they will focus you.  
    Mercy - Fixed a mercy glitch that caused her to deal 0% damage from the start.  Mercy’s charm no longer has a cooldown, but now it only lasts 5 seconds.  Charm now only grants 10% damage, but resurrections also give her 10% damage now.  
    Moira - Polished her bomb scripts, she now pulsates for far less damage per tick while building the bomb, fixed an issue with the bomb dealing damage outside of the bomb on detonation.  The bomb now deals damage once per explosion (4 times) at the end, and it’s based on how much you built up.  The bomb’s damage will scale as the game progresses.  
    Reinhardt - Fire Strike now burns bots again, but no longer knocks down and has a 1 second cooldown.  His shield now heals him for 5% of his max health instead of a flat 50 hp every second while deployed.  
    Reaper - Fixed an exploit oversight with Rampage when switching characters while Rampage was on.  
    Sombra - Lowered Max Health slightly, buffed her damage.  Sombra wasn’t doing double damage with her backstab, she was doing like x10 damage, so I fixed it.  She’s meant to be a support DPS because of her ability to CC so hard.  So yeah she’s not meant to outshine characters like Widowmaker or Ashe in terms of damage.  
    Symmetra - Re-worked her a bit, she can’t be damaged now at all but she also can’t contest the point if she’s the only one on the point.  WIP, needs testing, etc.  
    Widowmaker - Explosion damage increased slightly, radius halved but still based on charge.  
    Zenyatta - Increased primary healing from 40 to 100.  
  
  SUPERBOTS:  
    Torbjorn - Removed fire aura.  
    Roadhog - Removed breather knockback.  
    Zarya - Buffed damage.  Death Sphere now causes a burning effect for clarity and her sphere should do a flat 25% of your max health, this is still reduced by your current armor.  Once you have 25% or less, it will deal even more damage based on Zarya’s current damage increase.  Needs testing.  
    Lucio - Reduced healing by half, his healing was off the charts.  Buffed “World on Fire” roulette event so it is more deadly, seeing as nobody has ever died from it.  
    Reaper - Nerfed his damage slightly.  Reaper should now stun everyone that gets touched by his ultimate, instead of just the first person.  You can only be stunned once per every 3 seconds.
